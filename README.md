# any-vm-runner
Use to run guest VMs when they were previously installed in .qcow2 virtual disk files, inside docker containers.  Using this, you can run any OS you like in a docker container on your linux docker host.

I'll add more detail in time.

This is really just a holding place for more documentation and detail to be added later.
The meat of the documentation is on docker hub.

Please raise any questions or issues here.
